            <h2>Web App Development</h2>
            <p>Web application development is the creation of application programs that reside on remote servers and are delivered to the userâ€™s device over the Internet. A web application (web app) does not need to be downloaded and is instead accessed through a network. An end user can access a web application through a web browser such as Google Chrome, Safari, or Mozilla Firefox. A majority of web applications can be written in JavaScript, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and HTML5.</p>
